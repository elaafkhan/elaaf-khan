Kursi - Plastic Object Identifier

This project helps identify plastic objects and sends them to the right conveyor belt:

Black → Belt A

Transparent → Belt B

Colorful → Belt C

How to Use

Open the index.html file in your browser.

Upload a picture of a plastic object.

The system will tell you which belt it goes to.

Place your example images inside the folders:

dataset/black/

dataset/transparent/

dataset/colorful/

Each folder should have 10–20 sample images.
